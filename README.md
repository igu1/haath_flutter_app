#  Disaster Management App   
*A Hackathon Project™ (aka 24 hours of chaos)* when i am 1st year student

## What is this?  
This is supposed to be a **super cool disaster management app** — you know, alerts, SOS requests, helping people without the internet, saving the world, etc.  

…Except we ran out of time. ⏳  
So what you’re looking at is basically the **skeleton of greatness**.  

## The Real Villain   
This project wasn’t destroyed by lack of ideas.  
It wasn’t destroyed by sleep deprivation.  
It was destroyed by… **Gradle.**  

Yes, a Gradle issue blocked all of us for HOURS.  
Even the *judge of the hackathon* tried to fix it — and failed.  
Legend says, if i run `flutter run` today, i’ll still see Gradle laughing.  

## Features (in theory )  
-  Send disaster alerts to users  
-  Request help even without internet (yeah, that was the idea…)  
-  Maybe a map? (if we had the time)  
-  Bugs are not features, but you’ll find them anyway  

## Features (in reality )  
- A Flutter project that compiles (hopefully… if Gradle allows it).  
- Some UI sprinkled here and there.  
- A dream of what could’ve been.  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disaster_management_app.git  
cd disaster_management_app  
flutter pub get  
flutter run
